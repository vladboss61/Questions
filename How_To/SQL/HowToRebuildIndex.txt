Over the course of time B-Tree indexes may become fragmented because of updating/deleting/inserting data.
In SQLServer terminology we can have internal (index page which is half empty )
and external (logical page order doesn't correspond physical order).
Rebuilding index is very similar to dropping and re-creating it.

We can re-build an index with
ALTER INDEX index_name REBUILD;

By default rebuilding index is offline operation which locks the table and prevents DML against it , but many RDBMS
allow online rebuilding. Also, some DB vendors offer alternatives to index rebuilding such as REORGANIZE
(SQLServer) or COALESCE/SHRINK SPACE(Oracle).
