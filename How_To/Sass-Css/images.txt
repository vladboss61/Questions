You should save the image at
the same width and height it will
appear on the website. If
the image is smaller than the
width or height that you have
specified, the image can be
distorted and stretched. If the
image is larger than the width
and height if you have specified,
the image will take longer to display on the page.

Computer screens are made up
of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch,
and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in
images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to
download.
