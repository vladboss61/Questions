Is it wrong to place the <script> tag after the </body> tag?

Not Correct in browsers like IE
<html>
  ....
  <body>
     ....
  </body>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="theJs.js"></script>
</html>

Correct Everywhere
<html>
  ....
  <body>
     ....
     <script type="text/javascript" src="theJs.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

It won't validate outside of the <body> or <head> tags. It also won't make much difference — unless
you're doing DOM manipulations that could break IE before the body element is fully loaded — to putting it just before the closing </body>.
Only comments and the end tag for the html element are allowed after the end tag for the body.
